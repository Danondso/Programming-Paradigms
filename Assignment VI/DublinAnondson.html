<div id = "a">I was born in Anchorage Alaska in December 1992, when I was 3 I was matched against a grizzly bear in a fight to the death. Luckily, I <br>
              had the power of my ancestors at my disposal, and I defeated him with hyperbeam. Afterwards, I went sledding at a hill near my house, <br>
              the hill was called moose hill and it was the best hill in my neighborhood. In 2003, I moved to New Jersey, it was a real culture shock <br>
              I met a lot of unique people there. Every year, the neighborhoods would have a cleanup week, where they could get rid of large stuff<br>
              and people would come pick the stuff up. I was lucky enough to get a 1985 Fender Stratocaster, It didn't have the pickups or anything<br>
              so I ended up buying an EMG-85 to put in it. It's one of my favorite guitars now, it might be beat up, but it's my baby.</div>
